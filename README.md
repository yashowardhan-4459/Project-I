A voice-activated AI system built from scratch. Wakes on command. Listens. Learns. Automates.


# 🧠 Project I — Day 1

> _“It isn’t an app. It isn’t a bot. It isn’t ordinary.”_  
> _“It listens. It understands. It responds.”_

Welcome to **Project I** — a personal AI system being built entirely from scratch.  
Designed to wake up only on specific voice commands, recognize the creator’s voice, and automate system-level tasks — all without relying on any pre-built framework.

## 💭 Why “Project I”?

Because it’s not just a tool — it’s a system that listens, learns, and evolves.  
What “I” stands for? That’s a secret — for now.
